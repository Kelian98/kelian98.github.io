Hi! I am PhD student in physics at Laboratoire Univers et Particules de Montpellier (CNRS/IN2P3), with a master's degree in aerospace engineering.
I am a member of the LSST Dark Energy Science Collaboration (DESC), the Zwicky Transient Facility (ZTF) and mainly involved in the StarDICE calibration metrology experiment for next-generation surveys. 

Although I have a broad interest in various aspects of astrophysics and cosmology thematics, my primary research revolves around the reduction of calibration uncertainties for dark energy measurement. As an experimental scientist with a background in engineering, a significant portion of my efforts is dedicated to develop and enhance instruments I employ and analyzing the data they collect.
