This is the repository for my personal website. Visit it at [https://kelian98.github.io](https://kelian98.github.io)

## Credits

The website is based on Michael Rose's [Minimal Mistakes](https://github.com/mmistakes/minimal-mistakes) Jekyll theme and mainly inspired by [Jonas Renault's](https://github.com/jonasrenault/jonasrenault.github.io) custom version.

## Usage

To setup an environment to run the website in development, execute

```console
bundle install
```

then

```console
bundle exec jekyll serve --incremental
```

to serve the website locally and watch changes.
