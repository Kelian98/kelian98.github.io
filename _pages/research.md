**Calibration of an uncooled infrared thermal camera for astrophysical site characterization**\
<span class="small-grey"><i class="fas fa-tools" aria-hidden="true"></i> Python, Linux, Raspberry Pi, calibration, sensors </span>\
Part of the main project of the PhD thesis subject. I am in charge of establishing a complete calibration bench setup to radiometrically calibrate an uncooled infrared thermal camera. As these sensors are sensitive to various sources of noise, it is indispensable to map the electronic response of the camera in ADU to a blackbody reference with known temperature and surface emissivity. Large amount of data accumulating +300,000 images acquired during December 2022 at IJCLab in CERN experiment test climatic chamber facility. Data is analyzed and compared to a camera response model. Each of the 640x512 pixels of the focal plane array is corrected for non-uniformity in response.
